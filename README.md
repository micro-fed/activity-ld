# Activity-LD: A Linked Data Approach to Activity Streams and ActivityPub for Microservices

## Abstract

This note presents "Activity-LD," a framework designed to facilitate the implementation of Activity Streams and ActivityPub in a microservices architecture. In aligning closely with best practices in Linked Data, it ensures backwards compatibility and interoperability with existing systems, promotes user privacy and control, and fosters seamless service transitions.

## Introduction

Activity-LD is a comprehensive solution to manage microservices in a Linked Data context, using the widely adopted standards of Activity Streams and ActivityPub. It comprises small, modular components—including profile, inbox, outbox, and auth modules—that can function independently or collaboratively. As a commitment to universal compatibility and modern development, Activity-LD adheres to all relevant standards.

## Principles

Activity-LD is designed around several key principles:

1. **Backwards Compatibility**: Activity-LD is crafted to interact seamlessly with existing systems, thereby fostering adoption and integration without disruption to current operations.

2. **Modularity**: Activity-LD is comprised of distinct components that can operate autonomously or in conjunction, offering the flexibility necessary to cater to diverse use cases and architectural needs.

3. **Standards Compliance**: As a commitment to interoperability and accessibility, Activity-LD fully complies with established W3C standards, ensuring that any compliant service can interact with it.

4. **Best Practices in Linked Data**: Leveraging the power of Linked Data, Activity-LD delivers highly connected, semantically rich data that drives informed decision-making and efficient service coordination.

## Compatibility with Existing Systems

Activity-LD has been built with a clear focus on bridging and adapting to existing systems, such as Solid, Nostr, Mostr, and more. The design philosophy encourages the development of adapters to facilitate communication and data sharing across platforms, promoting a vibrant ecosystem of interdependent services.

## User Privacy and Control

With the growing emphasis on user privacy and data control, Activity-LD integrates features that allow users to own and manage their private keys. This empowers users to control their digital identities, thereby bolstering privacy and enhancing trust in digital services.

## Nomadic Identity

In line with the vision of a flexible and user-centric digital landscape, Activity-LD supports nomadic identities. This allows users to move freely from one service to another, ensuring uninterrupted access to their data and services, and reducing the risk of vendor lock-in.

## Conclusion

Activity-LD is a forward-looking approach to leveraging the power of Linked Data in microservices architecture. By harmonizing Activity Streams and ActivityPub with user privacy and control, it creates a robust, flexible, and standards-compliant framework ready for the future of digital services.
